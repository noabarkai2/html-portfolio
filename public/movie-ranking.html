<h1>The Best Movies Acordding To Noa</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Twilight</h3>
<p>
  I love the mysterious vibe and the romantic tension between characters from
  diffrent worlds(human and vampire).
</p>

<h3>Through My Window</h3>
<p>The mix of forbidden love, and self-discovery really captivates me.</p>

<h3>After That...</h3>
<p>
  The dramatic romance and the complex relationships keep me emotionally hooked
  deeply invested.
